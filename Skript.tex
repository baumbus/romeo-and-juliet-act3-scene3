\stagedir{Ironically}

You can come out now Mr. Montague.

\talkromeo
\stagedir{Talking to himself, ignoring \lawrence}
Oh, I am so cooked! I'm so dead! My life is over! What can I do?

\talklawrence
\stagedir{Walks around the table and looks at \romeo, who is still frantically talking to himself.}
You've been banned from the casino, you shouldn't be here.

\talkromeo
\stagedir{Pulls out gun from under the table and points it in a non serious manner with one hand at \lawrence}
Ha! You people can kill me before you can ban me!

\talklawrence
Romeo, calm yourself. I am here to help.

\talkromeo
Help? There's nothing left so save! This is my life! There's nothing out there for me except pain and torture!

\talklawrence
Young man, be reasonable. It could have ended much worse for you. You could be behind bars right now. Or in crippling debt. Be grateful for what you still have.

\talkromeo
Be grateful? Oh yeah, I'm so grateful that you have separated me from the only thing that is keeping me sane! I am so grateful that you have separated me from my one true love!

\talklawrence
Now listen here youn man! I-

\talkromeo
\stagedir{Cutting \lawrence\ off}
Oh what do you know? You have no idea what it fells like - to lose someone you love!

\talklawrence
Get over yourself already! Think Romeo, think!

\talkromeo
Think?! Think?! Can thinking create a Juliet out of thin air?! Can it move a building ?! Can it alleviate this ever lasting pain?!

\talklawrence
No, but it can put an end to this madness. Listen to yourself, Romeo.

\talkromeo
I am listening! to a ppor guy who has just been able to truly connect with his other half. A poor guy who is now no longer whole anymore.

\stagedir{\angelica\ knocks on the door}

\talklawrence
Quick, someone's here, hide unter the table.

\talkromeo
What's the point of hiding?

\stagedir{Knocking}

\talklawrence
Ack! You fool! - coming! - go hide, Romeo, it sounds urgent! - be right there!

\stagedir{Knocking}
Hide. Under. The. Desk!

Who's there? What's the matter? - Just listen to me and hide Romeo!
\stagedir{\romeo\ hides under the desk}

\talkangelica
It's me Angelica, it's about Juliet.

\talklawrence
Come in.
\stagedir{Opens door}

\talkangelica
\stagedir{Enters the room}
Romeo! Where is he?!

\talklawrence
\stagedir{Points towards the desk}
There on the ground. Wallowing in despair. Drowning in self-pity.

\talkangelica
Ugh, tell me about it! Juliet's no different... truly a math made in heaven.
\stagedir{Walks over to \romeo}
Stand up and be a man! What would Juliet think if she saw you now? She needs you!
\stagedir{\romeo\ scoffs}
You think you're so special. Well, news flash: everyone has to face obstacles from time to time!

\talkromeo
Did you say Juliet? Where is she? Does she hate me? What does she say to the end of our love? Will there ever be a chance of us getting back together? And if so, will this moment forever define us?

\talkangelica
How would I know; she does nothing but cry. She's being a drama queen, just like you. I have heard your name so much, I'm getting sick of it.

\talkromeo
My name? If it's my name that causes this agony, this anguish, then I shall do everything in my power to get rid of it for good.
\stagedir{Moves the gun towards his head}

\talkangelica
\stagedir{Quickly holds down his arm}
What the hell!

\talklawrence
\stagedir{Manages to get the gun out of \romeo's hands}
You absolute buffoon! You idiot! You lunatic!
\stagedir{Stows the gun away}
Romeo! Think! Be a man! I thought, being in this business, you'd have better control over your temper. Have you done wrong in game? Will you do yourself and Juliet wrong? It would be a disgrace to yourself, your family and Juliet. How will your death help any of them? And you'd get nothing back that you believe you have lost now. Why can't you recognize how lucky you are? You could be in debt or even in prison, but you have been simply banned from one casino! People who can't see their own fortune are doomed to live a life of torture.
\stagedir{Sips a glass of water}
Go! Go see Juliet! She needs your comfort. Console her! Just look out that security doesn't see you. Then you two come to me and I will wed the both of you. When you are married no one will question the validity of your relationship. You, Romeo, will be forgiven by Juliet's, by my family. They will want to keep the peace in their own family, which you will be part of. It will end the lifelong rivalry between our families!

Angelica! Go tell Juliet to stay somewhere where no security guard will be able to see them. Roneo will come to see her!

\talkangelica
Oh Laurie, thank god! I'll go tell Juliet that Romeo's coming. Oh and here, Romeo.
\stagedir{Gives Romeo a necklace}
Juliet wanted me to give it to you.
\stagedir{Leaves the room}

\talkromeo
Oh thank you Friar, I don't know how I could ever thank you.
\stagedir{Vigorously shakes \lawrence's hand}

\talklawrence
Now go, Romeo, go to her.

\talkromeo
\stagedir{Leaves the room}
