\newactnamed{Act 3}

\newscenenamed{Scene 3}

\stagedir{\lawrence's office: enter \lawrence}

\talklawrence
You can come out now Mr. Montague.

\stagedir{\romeo\ appears from under the table}

\talkromeo
Nothing escapes your eyes, huh?

\stagedir{\romeo\ seats himself on \lawrence's chair \\ \lawrence\ takes a sip from the glass and lays it down on the table}

\talklawrence
You've been banned from the casino, you shouldn't be here.

\talkromeo
Ha! You people can kill me before you can ban me!

\talklawrence
The world is a big place, you need not constrict your life to this place.

\talkromeo
This is my life! There's nothing out there for me except pain and torture!

\stagedir{\lawrence\ sighs}

\talklawrence
Youngster, do you not know the value of life? Be thankful the verdict was only banishment.

\talkromeo
Be thankful? You rob me access to this heaven on earth and you believe I should be thankful? Heaven is where Juliet is, all that awaits me out there is hell! You are but a cruel businessman, how would you know of true love!

\stagedir{\romeo\ stands up facing \lawrence}

\talklawrence
Now listen here young man!

\talkromeo
La La La La La

\talklawrence
Oh stop being such a child! Think Romeo, think!

\talkromeo
Think?! Think?! Can thinking creat a Juliet out of thin air?! Can it move a building?! Can it undo my banishment?!

\stagedir{\romeo\ stands up again and faces \lawrence}

\talklawrence
So not only are you mad, but you are also deaf.

\talkromeo
What is to listen, when the wise man is blind.

\stagedir{\lawrence\ takes a deep breath}

\talklawrence
Let us all calm down for a moment and review the situation.

\talkromeo
You don't know the situation! You can't know the situation! Think yourself in my shoes for once! Do you have the slightest idea what I'm going through?! If you knew, you would understand the agony I'm going through.

\stagedir{\angelica\ knocks on the door}

\talklawrence
Quick, someone's here, hide under the desk.

\talkromeo
No! I won't hide away any longer!

\stagedir{Knocking}

\talklawrence
Ack! You fool! - Who's there? - Go hide, Romeo! - Be right there!

\stagedir{Knocking}

Hide. Under. The. Desk!

Coming! - Just listen to me and hide Romeo!

\talkangelica
It's me Angelica, friend of Juliet.

\talklawrence
Come in.

\stagedir{Opens door \\ Enter \angelica}

\talkangelica
Romeo! Where is he?!

\talklawrence

\stagedir{Points towards the desk}

There on the ground. Wallowing in despair.

\talkangelica
Ugh, these two, truly a match made in heaven.

\stagedir{Walks over to \romeo\ and kicks him on the side}

Are you not man enough to even stand up yourself? What would Juliet think if she saw you now.

\talkromeo
Argh!

\stagedir{He rises}

\talkangelica
Welcome back to the world of the living.

\talkromeo
Did you say Juliet? Is she disgusted by actions? Where is she? Is she ok? What does she say to the end of our love?

\talkangelica
She's being a drama queen, just like you.

\talkromeo
Oh it must pain her so to hear my name, the name of a filthy cheater. If so then I must erase this name from existence!

\stagedir{Pulls out a gun from under the desk, \angelica\ quickly holds down his arms \\ \lawrence\ manage to get the gun out of \romeo's hands}

\talklawrence
You absolute buffoon! You idiot! You unreasonable beast! What the fuck are you thinking!

\stagedir{\lawrence\ stows the gun away}

I am disappointed, I expected more of you. You wanted to kill yourself, because of what? Because you cheated in my casino? Because you might never see Juliet again? Will you use your goddamn mind for even a second you absolute buffoon? Oh for goodness' sake.

\stagedir{\lawrence\ takes a large sip of water}

If you truly wanted to die, you wouldn't have come here to me. So tell me, do you truly with to die?

\stagedir{\romeo\ looks away}

If you truly love her, then go to her, comfort her, reconcile with her. Here, I can help, I could marry the two of you officially, maybe then we can put all this behind us.

\talkangelica
Oh god bless you Friar. I'll go tell Juliet that Romeo's coming.

\stagedir{\angelica\ exits}

\talkromeo
Oh thank you Friar, I don't know how I could ever thank you.

\stagedir{Vigorously shakes \lawrence's hand}

\talklawrence
Now go, Romeo, go to her.

\stagedir{\romeo\ exits}
